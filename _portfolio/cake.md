The [stove](https://github.com/statgarten/stove) package provides functions for ML modeling. Packages from the Tidymodels were used, but they were configured to be easy for ML beginners to use. Although it belongs to [statgarten](https://github.com/statgarten) whose packages are incorporated in shiny app, stove package also can be used for itself in console.
